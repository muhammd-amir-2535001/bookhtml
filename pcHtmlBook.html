 <h1> Structural markup:tags</h1>
 <p>Structural markup in HTML refers to the use of specific HTML tags to organize and define 
    the overall structure of a webpage's content. These tags are used to create a logical 
    hierarchy within the document, indicating the relationships between different sections 
    and elements. Structural markup is essential for proper layout, styling, and accessibility 
    of a webpage.Structural markup is primarily concerned with dividing the content into 
    different sections, such as headers, footers, navigation menus, main content areas, 
    sidebars, and more. By using appropriate structural markup, you create a clear separation 
    of different parts of your webpage, making it easier to style and format, and improving 
    the overall user experience</p>
 <br>
 <h2>header</h2>
 <p> header: Represents the header section of a webpage.</p>
 <br>
 <h2>nav</h2>
 <p> nav: Defines a navigation menu.</p>

   <h1> Semantic markup:tags</h1>
   <p>Semantic markup in HTML refers to the practice of using specific HTML tags to give meaning 
    and structure to the content on a webpage. It involves using tags that accurately describe 
    the purpose and type of content they enclose, making the content's meaning clear to both 
    browsers and search engines.
    Semantic markup enhances the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and overall 
    readability of a webpage. It helps to create a more understandable and well-structured
     document by choosing appropriate tags for different types of content.
     <br>
    For example, 
    <br>instead of using generic tags like div or span to style or position content, semantic
     markup encourages the use of tags like `header, nav, main, article, section, footer,
     h1 to h6,` and other specific tags that convey the actual meaning of the content they wrap.

    <h1> paragraph tags</h1>
    <p>The paragraph tag in HTML is represented by the 'p' element. It is used to define
    and enclose a block of text that forms a paragraph. The 'p' tag is one of the most
    fundamental and commonly used HTML tags for organizing textual content on a webpage</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text. It can contain multiple sentences and provides a logical
        <br>
        <p><b>In the example above, the text within the p tags is considered a paragraph. 
            Browsers typically render paragraphs with a bit of space above and below them, 
            visually separating them from surrounding content.The p tag is important for 
            both structural organization and styling purposes. By using p tags to define 
            paragraphs, you create a clear separation between different blocks of text. 
            Additionally, you can apply CSS styles to p tags to control the font, spacing, 
            alignment, and other visual aspects of the paragraphs.It's worth noting that 
             you can have multiple paragraphs on a webpage by using multiple p tags. 
            For instance:</b></p>
            <h2>talic</h2>
            <p><i>In HTML, the bold and italic formatting is achieved using the b and i tags, 
                respectively. However, it's important to note that these tags are not strictly 
                used for styling anymore. They were traditionally used for bold and italic formatting, 
                but in modern HTML, they are considered presentational and are often avoided in favor 
                of CSS for styling.Here's a brief explanation of their historical and presentational 
                uses:b Tag: The b tag was originally used to make text bold. However, it doesn't 
                provide any semantic meaning to the text it surrounds. Instead, it only changes 
                the visual appearance by making the text bold. As a result, it's considered better

                <h2>strong tag</h2>
                content. While it typically renders text in bold, its main purpose is to convey the significance of 
                the text for screen readers and search engines, not just for visual styling.
                Example
                <br>This is a strong tag <strong>critical strong tag</strong> point to consider.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>em tag</h2>
                <br>
                <p> em Tag: The em tag is used to emphasize its enclosed content, which usually results in rendering 
                    the text in italics. Like the <strong> tag, its primary purpose is to provide semantic meaning, 
                        making it useful for screen readers and SEO.
                        Example:
                    <br>
                    This statement is <em>"very important em tag"</em> for our discussion.</p>

                    <h1>blockquote</h1>
                <p>The blockquote tag in HTML is used to indicate that a section of text is a block quotation, 
                    which is a passage taken from another source. This tag is used to visually set off the quoted 
                    content and typically indents it from both the left and right margins, 
                    making it stand out from the rest of the text.</p>
                    <h2>q tag</h2>
                    <p> <q>The q tag </q>in HTML is used to define a short inline quotation, typically enclosed 
                    within quotation marks. It indicates that a specific portion of text is a direct quote from 
                    another source. The <q> tag helps distinguish quoted text from the surrounding content and 
                        provides semantic meaning to the quoted material.</p>

                        <h2>abbr tag</h2>
                        <p>The <abbr> tag in HTML is used to define an abbreviation or acronym and provides additional 
                            information about the abbreviated term. This tag is particularly helpful for making the 
                            meaning of abbreviations clear to users, especially when they hover over the abbreviation or 
                            acronym, as most browsers display a tooltip with the full expansion of the term.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> is an essential part of the internet.</p>
                            <br>
                            <abbr title="my name abbrtag">
                            <br>In this example, <br>
                            the abbr tag is used to indicate that "WWW" stands for "World Wide Web." When users 
                            hover over "WWW," the browser tooltip will display the full expansion of the term.
                            The title attribute within the abbr tag is crucial because it holds the full form of
                            the abbreviation or acronym. This attribute is what browsers use to generate the tooltip 
                            when users hover over the abbreviated term.Using the abbr tag improves the accessibility
                            and clarity of your content, ensuring that readers understand the meaning behind abbreviations 
                            or acronyms, especially those that might not be immediately recognizable to everyone.</abbr>

                            <p>In HTML, citations and definitions can be marked up using the "cite" and "dfn" tags 
                                respectively. These tags are part of the semantic HTML elements that help provide 
                                additional meaning and context to specific parts of your content.</p>

                                        It helps indicate that the enclosed text is a definition of a particular word or term.</p>

                                                The <address> tag in HTML is used to provide contact information for the author, owner, or publisher of a document or a section of a document. It's commonly used in the context of a footer to display contact details, such as an email address, physical address, phone number, or website URL.
                                                    
                                                    Here's how the <address> tag is used:
                                                        
                                                         html

                                                        </address>
                                                        In this example,<br> the address tag is used to enclose contact information. 
                                                        The information within the address tag is often styled differently than the 
                                                        regular text on the page to visually indicate that it's contact information.                                          
                                                        It's important to note that the address tag doesn't have a strict semantic 
                                                        meaning beyond providing contact information. It's up to you how you use it 
                                                        grouping of content.</p>
                                                        in your document, whether for contact details, author information, or other

                                                        similar purposes. Additionally, like other HTML elements, you can apply CSS 
                                                        styles to the address tag to control its appearance.Keep in mind that while 
                                                        the address tag can be used for contact information, it's not necessarily 
                                                        the best choice for marking up structured data like addresses. For structured data, 
                                                        using appropriate schema markup (such as Schema.org) is recommended for better SEO and

<h1> Definition lists</h1>
<p>In HTML, definition lists are created using the "dl" (definition list) element. 
    They are used to display terms and their corresponding definitions. Each term is 
    represented by the dt (definition term) element, and each definition is represented 
    by the dd (definition description) element. Here's an example of how you can create 
    a definition list with a term and its definition using HTML code:</p>
<h2>Definition List Example</h2>
  
<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>Definition of Term 1 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
    Dicta cupiditate expedita earum reiciendis neque ipsam ullam cum saepe nihil nobis,

<h1>X Creating links between pages</h1>

<p>Creating links between pages in HTML is done using the "a" (anchor) element. An anchor element 
    creates a hyperlink to another web page, a file, an email address, or another resource. 
    Here's an example of how you can create links between two HTML pages using HTML code:</p>
    <a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>
    <p><b>Assuming you have two HTML files, let's call them page1.html and page2.html. 
        Here's how you can create links from page1.html to page2.html and vice versa
    </b><li>In the above example, the "a" element is used to create hyperlinks. The href 
        attribute specifies the URL of the page or resource you want to link to. In this case, 
        the URLs are relative file paths because the pages are in the same directory.When 
        you view page1.html in a browser, you'll see a link that says "Go to Page 2". 
        Clicking on it will take you to page2.html. Similarly, on page2.html, clicking the 
        link "Go to Page 1" will take you back to page1.html</li></p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h1> Linking to other sites</h1>
        <p>
            Linking to other websites in HTML is done in the same way as linking between pages within 
            your own website. You use the 'a' (anchor) element and provide the URL of the external site 
            in the href attribute. Here's an example of how you can create a link to an external website 
            using HTML code:</p>
        <h1>External Link Example</h1>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?nis=true&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B7dBT5kK7TqGDTfnUAK%2FVhA%3D%3D" target="_blank">linkedin</a>
        <br>
        <p>In this example, the "a" element's href attribute contains the URL of the external website you 
            want to link to (in this case, linkedin's website). The target="_blank" attribute opens the link 
            in a new browser tab or window, allowing users to easily return to your website.When you view this 
            HTML in a browser, you'll see a link that says "linkedin". Clicking on it will take you to the linkedin 
            website.Remember to provide accurate and relevant links, and ensure that you have the necessary 
            permissions or rights to link to external websites.
        </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h1> Email links</h1>
        <p>Creating email links in HTML is done using the "a" (anchor) element as well. To create an email 
            link, you use the mailto: protocol followed by the email address you want to link to. Here's an 
            example of how you can create an email link using HTML code</p>
        <h2>Email Link Example</h2>
        <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignOutOptions?hl=en&continue=https://mail.google.com&service=mail&ec=GBRAFw"> Muhammad Amir :Email.com</a>
        <p>In this example, the "a" element's href attribute starts with lalkhan: followed by the email address you want to link 
            to. When a user clicks on the "Email Us" link, it will open their default email client with a  
            new email addressed to the specified email address</p>

<h1> How to add images to pages</h1>
<p>To add images to web pages in HTML, you can use the "img" (image) element. 
    The "img" element allows you to embed images into your web page by specifying 
    the image's source (URL) and optional attributes such as alt text, width, and 
    height. Here's an example of how you can add an image to a web page using HTML 
    code:</p>
    <h2>Image Example</h2>
    <img src="imageAmir/imageAmir.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape" width="400" height="300">
    
    <p>In this example:<br>The "img" element is used to embed the image.<br>The src attribute specifies 
        the URL of the image. You need to replace "image.jpg" with the actual path to your image.<br>
        The alt attribute provides alternative text for the image. It's important for accessibility and 
        SEO, as it's displayed if the image cannot be loaded.<br>The width and height attributes specify 
        the dimensions of the image in pixels. These attributes are optional and can be omitted if you want 
        the image to be displayed at its natural size.Make sure to replace "image.jpg" with the actual path 
        to your image file. You can use either a relative path or an absolute URL.<br>Remember that using 
        appropriate image file formats (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF) and optimizing images for web use (resizing 
        and compressing) can help improve your website's loading performance.

  <h1>Choosing the Right Image Format for Your HTML Pages</h1>
  
  <dl>
    <dt>JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):</dt>
    <dd>Best for photographs and images with a wide range of colors and gradients.<br>
    Supports compression, allowing for smaller file sizes while maintaining decent image quality.<br>
    Lossy compression can lead to some loss of quality, especially at lower compression levels.<br>
    Suitable for images where a small amount of quality loss is acceptable.</dd>
    
    <dt>PNG (Portable Network Graphics):</dt>
    <dd>Supports lossless compression, preserving image quality without significant loss.<br>
    Ideal for images with sharp edges, text, and areas of flat color.<br>
    Supports transparency, making it suitable for images with transparent backgrounds.<br>
    Can result in larger file sizes compared to JPEG, especially for complex images.</dd>
    
    <dt>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format):</dt>
    <dd>Supports animations and transparency.<br>
    Limited color palette (256 colors), suitable for simple graphics and animations.<br>
    Used for small animations, icons, and graphics with limited colors.</dd>
    
    <dt>WebP:</dt>
    <dd>Developed by Google, it provides both lossy and lossless compression.<br>
    Generally provides better compression and smaller file sizes compared to JPEG and PNG.<br>
    Support varies across browsers, with better support in modern browsers.</dd>
    
    <dt>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):</dt>
    <dd>Ideal for images with well-defined shapes and areas of solid color.<br>
    Vector format that scales without loss of quality.<br>
    Suitable for logos, icons, and graphics that need to be scaled to various sizes.</dd>

  <h1> Optimizing images for the web</h1>
  <p>Optimizing images for the web is crucial to ensure your web pages load quickly and 
    efficiently. Image optimization involves reducing the file size of images without 
    significantly sacrificing image quality. Here's how you can optimize images for the 
    web using HTML and some additional tips:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Compression:</dt>
        <dd>Use image compression to reduce file sizes. Utilize online tools or image editing software to compress images before adding them to your HTML.</dd>
        
        <dt>Image Formats:</dt>
        <dd>Choose the appropriate image format for your images. JPEG is suitable for photographs, PNG for images with transparency, and SVG for vector graphics.</dd>
        
        <dt>Image Dimensions:</dt>
        <dd>Resize images to the exact dimensions needed on your webpage. Avoid using larger images and then scaling them down using HTML or CSS.</dd>
        
        <dt>Responsive Images:</dt>
        <dd>Implement responsive image techniques to serve different image sizes based on the user's device screen size. This reduces unnecessary data usage on smaller screens.</dd>
        
        <dt>Lazy Loading:</dt>
        <dd>Implement lazy loading for images below the fold. This ensures that images only load when they enter the user's viewport, reducing initial page load times.</dd>

    (table data cell). Here's a basic example of how to create a table in HTML</b></p>
    <h1>Table Example</h1>
  
  <table border="1">
    <tr>

  <p><b>In this example, the "table" element defines the table, while each "tr" element represents 
    a table row. Within each row, you can use "th" elements for table headers (usually placed in 
    the first row) and "td" elements for table data cells.The border="1" attribute on the "table" 
    element is used to add a border to the table for visual clarity. However, it's generally better 
    to use CSS for styling.Remember that HTML tables are primarily used for tabular data.

  <h3><b>In this example,<br> the table is used to 
    display information about individuals including their names, ages, and countries. 
    The th elements in the first row represent table headers, while the td elements in 
    subsequent rows represent data cells.The included "style" section provides basic 
    styling for the table using CSS. The border-collapse property makes the cell borders 
    collapse into a single border, and the width property sets the table width to 100%. 
    The background-color property is used to add a light background color to the header 
    Remember that tables should be used for presenting tabular data. 
    For page layouts, it's recommended to use CSS for positioning and styling elements.</b></h3>

        <h1>Forms</h1>
        <p><b>
            Forms in HTML are used to collect user input and send it to a server for 
            processing. They allow users to enter data, make selections, and interact 
            with a web page. HTML provides a set of elements for creating forms, 
            including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, and 
            buttons. Here's an overview of the key form elements In this example, the  
            form includes text inputs, an email input, a textarea for messages, radio 
            buttons for gender, checkboxes for interests, and a submit button. The action 
            attribute of the "form" element specifies where the form data will be sent when 
            submitted, and the method attribute specifies the HTTP method to use for the 
            submission (usually "post" or "get").</b></p>

            <h1>X New HTML5 form controls</h1>
            <p>HTML5 introduced some new form controls that offer enhanced functionality and usability.
                 Here are a few of these new form controls along with their code examples:</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Date Input:</h2>
        <p><b>The input element with type="date" allows users to select a date from a date picker.</b></p>
        <label for="birthDate">Birth Date:</label>
        <input type="date" id="birthDate" name="birthDate">
        <br>
        <h2>Time Input</h2>
        <p><b>The input element with type="time" allows users to select a time from a time picker</b></p>
        <label for="meetingTime">Meeting Time:</label>
        <input type="time" id="meetingTime" name="meetingTime">
        <br>
        <h2>Color Input</h2>
        <p><b>The input element with type="color" creates a color picker</b></p>
        <label for="favoriteColor">Favorite Color:</label>
        <input type="color" id="favoriteColor" name="favoriteColor">
        <br>
        <h2>Range Input:</h2>
        <p><b>The input element with type="range" creates a slider control for selecting a value within a specified range.</b></p>
        <label for="volume">Volume:</label>
        <input type="range" id="volume" name="volume" min="0" max="100">
        <br>
        <h2>Search Input:</h2>
        <p>The "input" element with type="search" creates a search input field with built-in search features.</p>
        <label for="searchQuery">Search:</label>
        <input type="search" id="searchQuery" name="searchQuery">
        <br>
        <h2>URL Input:</h2>
        <p>The input element with type="url" creates a URL input field with URL validation.</p>
        <label for="website">Website:</label>
        <input type="url" id="website" name="website" placeholder="https://example.com">
        <br>
        <h2>Datetime Input:</h2>
        <p>The input element with type="datetime-local" allows users to select both date and time from a single control</p>
        <label for="eventDateTime">Event Date and Time:</label>
        <input type="datetime-local" id="eventDateTime" name="eventDateTime">
        <p>These HTML5 form controls provide more specialized input options, 
            making it easier for users to provide accurate and specific data. 
            You can use these controls to enhance the user experience of your forms.</p>

  <h1>X Specifying different versions of HTML</h1>
  <p>
    In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), different versions and document types can be specified 
    using the "!DOCTYPE" declaration at the beginning of an HTML document. The "!DOCTYPE" declaration 
    helps browsers and validators determine which version of HTML the document adheres to, 
    allowing them to correctly interpret and render the content.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>Here are examples of "!DOCTYPE" declarations for different versions of HTML:</b></h3>
    <br>
    <h2>HTML5:</h2>

    <h3><b>HTML5 is the current and most widely used version of HTML. Its ("!DOCTYPE") 
      declaration is quite simple:</b></h3>

      <h2>`"(!DOCTYPE html_)"
        <br>
        ("html")
        <br>
        -- Rest of the HTML content ---
        <br>
        ("/html")`
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h1>
          HTML 4.01:
        </h1>
        <h3><b>HTML 4.01 had several versions, and the "("!DOCTYPE")"" declaration varied depending on the 
          version and document type (Strict, Transitional, Frameset). <br>
          <br> example of the Transitional 
          version</b></h3>
          <h2>
            "("!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd")
            <br>
          html
          <br>
          -- Rest of the HTML content --
          <br>
          "(/html)"
          </h2>
          <h3>It's important to note that modern web development has largely shifted towards using HTML5 
            due to its improved features, semantics, and compatibility with a wide range of devices. 
            Therefore, you'll commonly encounter the HTML5 "("!DOCTYPE")" declaration in most web documents today.
          </h3>

          <h1>X Identifying and grouping elements</h1>
          <h2><i>In HTML, you can identify and group elements using classes and IDs. These are attributes that you can add
             to HTML elements to give them specific names or identifiers. Classes are used to group multiple elements together, 
             <br>
            <b>Here's a simple explanation with code</b></h2>
            <h2>
              Using Classes:
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>You can assign the same class to multiple elements to group them together. This is useful for 
              applying styles or behaviors to a group of similar elements.</p>
              <h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                (open tag: "style")
                <br>
                <br>
                  .highlight {
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    background-color: yellow;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  }
                  <br>
                  <br>
                (close tag:"/style")
                <br>
                <br>
                (open tag:"p")  class="highlight" > -- This paragraph is highlighted.--(closetag:"/p")
                <br>
                <br>
                (open tag:"p") --This paragraph is not highlighted.--(closetag:"/p")
                <br>
                <br>
                (open tag:"p") -- class="highlight">Another highlighted paragraph.--(closetag:"/p")
                <br>
                <br>
    
              </h2>
<hr>
<br>
<h1>Using IDs:</h1>
<p>IDs are unique identifiers for individual elements. 
  They should only be used once per page because each ID must be unique.</p>
<h2>

  open tag : style
  <br>
    #important {
      <br>
      font-weight: bold;
      <br>
    }
    <br>
  close tag :/style
  <br>
  
  opren tag:p id="important">
  <br>
  "---This paragraph is important--"
  <br>
  .close Tag =/p >
  <br>
  p tag --This paragraph is not important.--/p

  <br>
  <p>
  The paragraph with the ID "important" will have bold text in this example.
  <br>
  Remember:
  <br>
    Classes can be used on multiple elements.
    <br>
    IDs should be unique on a single page.
    <br>
    Use classes for grouping and styling similar elements.
    <br>
    Use IDs to uniquely identify specific elements, often for scripting or detailed styling.
    <br>
    By using classes and IDs, you can easily identify and group elements in your HTML to apply styles, 
    behaviors, or scripting as needed.</p>
</h2>
<h1>like this</h1>

<style>
  .highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
  }

  #important {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
</style>

<p class="highlight" id="important">This paragraph is both highlighted and important.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h1>X Comments, meta information and iframes</h1>
<br>
<h2>
  1. Comments:
</h2>
<p><b>Comments in HTML are used to include notes or explanations within the code that are not 
  displayed when the webpage is rendered by a browser. 
  They are useful for providing context to the code or temporarily disabling parts of it.</b></p>
  <h2>Comments Example</h2>
  <p>
    (open tag:"body")
    <br>
      (lessthen!-- This is a comment. It won't be displayed on the webpage. --greterthen)
      <br>
      p tag "This is a paragraph of text."  p tag
      <br>
      greterthen!--
      <br>
        This is a multi-line comment.
        <br>
        It can span several lines.
        <br>
      --lessthen
      <br>
      <h2> 2.Meta Information:</h2>
      <h3><b>Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding, 
        viewport settings, and more. These tags don't affect the visual 
        appearance of the page but provide important information to browsers
         and search engines.</b></h3>
         <br>
         <h3>In this example, the meta tags specify the character encoding
           (UTF-8) and set the initial scale for responsive design</h3>
           <br>
           <h2>3. Iframes:</h2>
           <p>An iframe (inline frame) is used to embed another HTML document or a web page within 
            the current document. This is often used to display external content, 
            like maps, videos, or other web pages, within your own page</p>
